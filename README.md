# polybar-configuration
Custom polybar configuration. Mainly here for backup when switching distro

## Polybar configuration
Place in $HOME/.config/polybar

## Spotify script
Now I don't remember where i scapped this script, but if you have the spotify app installed, it will scan for the current playing song on the local network and display in in polybar. Be sure to link the correct path to the script in the polybar configuration.
Also I think it needs python installed to be used.
